# Deprecated storage and bounded growth

This note covers three storage-hygiene tracks landed together. Each refers
back to a specific issue and the exact `DataKey` it touches, so a future
maintainer can decide whether the legacy compatibility shim is still
worth carrying.

## `DataKey::StakeCooldownEnd(Address)` — Issue #235

* Status: **deprecated, written for legacy clients but never read by
  active logic**.
* What it stored: a single `u64` cooldown timestamp per artisan.
* Why it was kept: older off-chain readers polled this key directly to
  show "stake unlocks at …" without understanding the queue layout.

### Active behaviour

* Active staking uses [`DataKey::ArtisanStakeQueue`]. `unstake_tokens`
  never reads the single timestamp; matured deposits are decided per
  queue entry.
* `stake_tokens` and `unstake_tokens` continue to mirror the maximum
  `cooldown_end` from the queue into this key so legacy readers still
  see a conservative value. Both call sites are now annotated with
  "DEPRECATED storage write" comments referencing this issue.
* When a queue empties, `unstake_tokens` removes the deprecated key
  alongside the queue and the stake record.
* Operators can call `purge_stake_cooldown_end(artisan)` (admin-only)
  to clear a stale entry without disturbing the queue. The function
  returns `true` when an entry was removed and `false` otherwise.

### Migration path

When the off-chain readers that depend on this single timestamp are
retired, drop both the mirror writes in `stake_tokens`/`unstake_tokens`
and the `DataKey::StakeCooldownEnd` variant in the same release. Until
then, the key must remain a *write-only* mirror.

## `DataKey::NextRecurringEscrowId` — Issue #233

* Status: **active, but bounded**.
* What it stores: the next `u64` ID for a recurring escrow.

### Active behaviour

* `MAX_RECURRING_ESCROW_ID = u64::MAX - 1` (defined in `lib.rs`) is the
  hard ceiling. `u64::MAX` is reserved as a sentinel.
* `create_recurring_escrow` rejects allocation past the cap with
  `Error::RecurringEscrowIdExhausted`. The increment uses
  `checked_add`, so the contract panics loudly rather than wrapping
  into an existing ID.
* The cap is far above any realistic deployment lifetime (one new
  recurring escrow per ledger for ~3 trillion years), so the bound is
  defensive — not a near-term operational concern. Its purpose is to
  remove the silent-collision failure mode entirely.

### Migration path

If recurring escrow churn ever needs ID recycling (e.g. a contract
fork that prunes long-cancelled escrows), introduce a separate
allocator with explicit free-list semantics; do not lower the cap on
this counter without a coordinated migration.

## `DataKey::BuyerEscrowCount` / `DataKey::SellerEscrowCount` — Issue #244

* Status: **active, indexed pattern documented**.
* What they store: a single `u32` per buyer/seller giving the total
  number of escrows that party has been involved in.

### Scaling characteristics

* Per-account: **O(1) storage**, **O(1) updates**. One ledger entry
  per buyer/seller, irrespective of how many escrows they have.
* Per-platform: footprint scales with the number of distinct
  participants, not with the number of escrows. There is no 64KB
  per-key limit to worry about because every escrow ID lives in its
  own `BuyerEscrowIndexed`/`SellerEscrowIndexed` entry.
* Pagination: `get_escrows_by_buyer` / `get_escrows_by_seller` read
  one indexed entry per item per page; cost is bounded by the page
  size, not the total count.
* TTL: like every other persistent entry, counts obey the standard
  TTL extension (`TTL_EXTENSION`). Inactive accounts archive
  naturally.

### Why not a sparser alternative?

A bitmap or sharded counter would compress storage if the platform had
millions of accounts that each held only a handful of escrows, but it
would penalise the common case (frequent reads/writes by active
buyers/sellers) with extra masking and indirection. The current
single-entry `u32` is the cheapest design that still preserves O(1)
updates and supports the indexed pagination pattern. We will revisit
if telemetry shows unique-account growth dominating storage cost.
